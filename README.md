### hi - i'm alan :)

I'm a senior in computer science. I'm currently wrapping up my last semester of university, and am looking forward to working full-time as a software engineer. 

In the internship experiences that I've been blessed with, I've had the opportunity to work in a wide variety of industries and company cultures, from a small startup to more mature tech companies. From these experiences, I've discovered that I most enjoy working on client/customer-facing products, doing work mostly on the backend. I am looking forward to the challenges of working as a software engineer full-time, and am excited to start building.

Cheers! 🎉
